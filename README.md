#  SpireOfCards
Project Initialized December 16, 2016, Declared Deprecated March 20, 2017.

Spire of Cards was a basic test project that allowed me to get a feel for the difficulty associated with getting an app onto my android cell phone.

As of March 20, 2017, there are no plans to ever add more to this project.  I have successfully added a blank app to my phone, so if there are plans to create an app in the future, I should have the skillset needed to do so.
