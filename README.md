Spire of Cards is a single player game with the following basics:
    It is played on a 4 by 4 board containing 9 empty spaces
    Each Player has 5 cards in their hand initially
    Each Card has 4 numbers denoting strength in a particular direction
    The game is over once all 9 spots on the board are filled


Technical Logistics:
    SpireOfCards is programmed primarily in Java for portability reasons
    It uses JFrames to create a portable GUI
    It stores card information inside a JSON database
